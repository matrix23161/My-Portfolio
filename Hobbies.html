            <h1>TRAVEL</h1>
            <p>Traveling by motorcycle and car has always been an obsession of mine. The open road calls upon me, giving a sense of freedom and adventure that is hard to match. Be it going along the coastal highways with wind on my hair, or twisting and turning down a winding mountain road, each ride is an ample opportunity to touch base with nature and explore gems hidden along the way. The thrill of riding my motorcycle brings an exhilarating sense of connection to the environment while the comfort of a car permits spontaneous road trips with friends and family. Every journey I take nurtures my spirit and love of adventure with the joy felt on the journey. </p>

            <h1>GAMING</h1>
            <p>Being a passionate gamer, I use various gaming platforms-mobile, console, and PC. Each platform gives a completely different experience to intensify my love for games. Mobile games allow me to play short sessions while busy on the go. Console games are graphically lovely and tell their wonderful stories based on a bigger screen and ambiance. On the other hand, PC gaming is special to me, being the place with the largest library of games, modding, and the option of customizing my setup for perfect gameplay.' This is where all strategies in a multiplayer shooter and open-world dives come to play, making this my escape away from the outside world and a connection to my dear friends. </p>
